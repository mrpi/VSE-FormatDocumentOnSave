VSE-FormatDocumentOnSave
========================
This branch is based on the work of Elders but calls the clang-format VS plugin for C++ files instead of the buildin code formatter. 

Enables auto formatting of the code when you save a file. Visual Studio supports auto formatting of the code with the CTRL+E,D or CTRL+E,F key shortcuts but with this extension the command 'Format Document' is executed on Save.
